# Senor-Hilter-Bot
My first discord music (maybe) bot.

# install and usage
* `npm install` (to install all bot dependencies)
* Create a `.env` in the same place as the `app.js`
  ```
  TOKEN=<bot token>
  CLIENT_ID=<bot client id>
  ```
* `npm run registerSlash` (to register all slash commands)
* `npm start` (if you want to run in the background, use `npm run pm2`)

# Example on running
